			<h3>Subjects of study</h3>
			<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility -- as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Turning <abbr>H<sub>2</sub>O</abbr> into wine, and the health benefits of Revertatrol (<abbr>C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub></abbr>.)</li>
				<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaysers at remperature exeeding <span>30<sup>o</sup>C</span> (<span>86<sup>o</sup>F</span>), when the audience size exponentially increase (effect of <span>3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup></span>.)</li>
				<li><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
